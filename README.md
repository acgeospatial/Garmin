# Garmin
My Work on using Garmin in PostGIS and QGIS

# Intro
If you use a Garmin activity tracker, like a sports watch, and have a Garmin connect account, then you can ask Garmin for a dump of all your data. Follow the instructions for [‘export all garmin data via account management center‘](https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=W1TvTPW8JZ6LfJSfK512Q8) I tried this and found the results a mass of folders and files. I don’t really want to request this everytime I want to look at my data and and don’t want to do it on an activity by activity basis. Fortunately there is a really useful GitHub repo that gives me everything I want called [garmin-connect-export](https://github.com/pe-st/garmin-connect-export?tab=readme-ov-file).
